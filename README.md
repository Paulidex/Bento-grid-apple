# 🎧 Apple Slide — Grid Practice

A practice project to master CSS Grid inspired by Apple's visual compositions.

## 📋 Description

I wanted to practice **CSS Grid** in a more realistic environment, so I looked for reference examples and noticed that Apple frequently uses this type of visual compositions in their products. I chose the **AirPods Pro 2** as inspiration to create an Apple-style slide.

### 🎨 Development Process
1. **Figma Design**: Created the complete design (structure, layout, and styles) to plan how elements would be organized within the grid
2. **Implementation**: Translated the design to code using HTML and CSS, replicating the idea of an Apple slide but built completely from scratch
3. **Optimization**: Focus on advanced Grid and Flexbox techniques

> **Note**: Current version is optimized for **desktop** only (responsive pending)
